1. Download the ISO image file of Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 from the official Steinberg website[^1^]. You will need a valid license key to activate the plugin.
2. Use any common burning software to create an installation DVD from the ISO image file. Alternatively, you can use a virtual drive software like WinCDEmu to mount the ISO image file as a virtual DVD.
3. Run the setup.exe file from the DVD or the virtual drive and follow the installation instructions. You may need to run the setup.exe file as an administrator or in compatibility mode for Windows XP.
4. After the installation is complete, copy the Hypersonic.dll file from the DVD or the virtual drive to your VST plugins folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\Vstplugins.
5. Launch your DAW and scan for new plugins. You should be able to find Hypersonic VSTi in your plugin list.
6. Enjoy using Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 on your Windows 64-bit computer!

Note: Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 may not work properly with some DAWs or plugins on Windows 64-bit systems. If you encounter any issues, you may want to upgrade to Hypersonic VSTi v2.0, which is fully compatible with Windows 64-bit systems and has more features and sounds than v1.0[^2^].

Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 is a versatile plugin that can be used for various genres and styles of music production. It has four sound engines that can produce realistic and expressive sounds, such as acoustic instruments, synthesizers, drums, and effects. You can also layer up to 16 sounds per patch and edit them with the built-in mixer and effects. Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 has a user-friendly interface that allows you to browse and select sounds from the 1.7 GB sound library, which contains 1,800 factory presets. You can also create your own sounds and save them as user presets.
 
However, Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 also has some limitations and drawbacks that you should be aware of. For instance, it does not support 64-bit processing, which means that it can only access up to 4 GB of RAM on your computer. This may cause memory issues or crashes if you use too many instances of the plugin or load too many sounds. Moreover, Hypersonic VSTi v1.0 does not have a standalone mode, which means that you can only use it within a DAW. It also does not support MIDI learn, which means that you cannot assign MIDI controllers to the plugin parameters.
 
Therefore, if you want to get the most out of Hypersonic VSTi v1.0, you should follow some best practices and tips. For example, you should close any unnecessary programs or processes on your computer to free up RAM and CPU resources. You should also use a low buffer size and a high sample rate in your DAW settings to reduce latency and improve sound quality. You should also avoid using too many effects or plugins on the same track or bus as Hypersonic VSTi v1.0, as they may cause conflicts or overload the plugin. Finally, you should save your work frequently and back up your files regularly to prevent data loss or corruption.
