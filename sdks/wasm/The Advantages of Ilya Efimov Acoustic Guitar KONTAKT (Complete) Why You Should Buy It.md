One of the main features of the Ilya Efimov Acoustic Guitar KONTAKT (Complete) bundle is the realistic legato and glissando. The legato mode allows you to play smooth transitions between notes by using hammer-on and pull-off techniques. The glissando mode allows you to slide from one note to another with different intervals and tempos. Both modes are activated by overlapping notes and can add a lot of expression and realism to your guitar playing.
 
The bundle also includes a MIDI-guitar mode that enables you to use a MIDI guitar controller to play the library. This mode allows you to take advantage of the natural playing technique of a guitar and use all the articulations and effects available in the library. You can also use a MIDI keyboard or any other MIDI controller to play the library, as it has an easy keyboard mode that maps the notes and articulations to different keys.
 
The Ilya Efimov Acoustic Guitar KONTAKT (Complete) bundle is a comprehensive and versatile acoustic guitar library that can suit any genre and style of music. It offers a high level of realism and expression, as well as a lot of control and customization options. The bundle is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS X, and works with any DAW that supports Kontakt. If you are looking for a realistic and expressive virtual acoustic guitar, you might want to check out this bundle.
