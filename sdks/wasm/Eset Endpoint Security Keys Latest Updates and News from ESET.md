Creating an Eset Business Account
An Eset Business Account is an online platform that lets you activate and manage your Eset products with your account credentials. You don't need to remember or enter a license key every time you install or update the software. You can also monitor the status of your devices and get reports on their security.
To create an Eset Business Account, follow these steps:

Go to https://eba.eset.com/ and click on Register.
Fill in the required information and agree to the terms and conditions.
Check your email for a confirmation link and click on it.
Log in to your Eset Business Account and click on Add License.
Select the product you want to activate and enter the license key you received from Eset or purchased from a reseller.
Click on Activate License and wait for the confirmation message.

Now you can use your Eset Business Account credentials to activate Eset Endpoint Security on your devices. You can also download the installer from your account dashboard.
Using a Free Key from a Third-Party Source
If you don't want to create an Eset Business Account or purchase a license key, you can try to find a free key from a third-party source. However, this method is not recommended as it may expose you to risks such as malware infection, legal issues, or product malfunction.

Some websites claim to offer free keys for Eset Endpoint Security, but they may be fake, expired, or stolen. They may also contain malicious links or ads that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy. Therefore, you should be careful and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files.
One example of such a website is EDLpoint.com, which claims to provide free keys for Eset Endpoint Security until 2023. However, there is no guarantee that these keys are valid or safe.

Go to https://www.edlpoint.com/eset-endpoint-security-free-license-keys/ and scroll down to find a list of keys.

Click on Activate this product and select Use a purchased License Key.
Paste the key in the License Key field and click on Activate.
Wait for the activation message and restart your computer if prompted.

Note that this method may not work as expected and may cause problems with your software or system. Therefore, it is advisable to use an official license key from Eset or a trusted reseller instead of relying on free keys from dubious sources.
