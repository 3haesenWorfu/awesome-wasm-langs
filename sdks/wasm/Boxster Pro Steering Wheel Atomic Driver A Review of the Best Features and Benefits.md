Another aspect to consider when buying the Boxster Pro Steering Wheel Atomic Driver is the price. According to some online sources, the wheel costs around $100 USD, which is relatively cheap compared to other steering wheels on the market[^2^].

They said that the wheel was too basic and outdated, and that they could find better options for a similar or lower price[^2^]. They also pointed out that the wheel did not have any warranty or customer service from Atomic Accessories[^1^]. Therefore, the price might not be a good indicator of the value of the wheel.
