## What is Plan IQ 2.6.7?
  
Plan IQ 2.6.7 is a software tool developed by OTHER, a company that specializes in optimization solutions for the woodworking industry. Plan IQ 2.6.7 was released in 2004 and has been used by many customers around the world since then.
  
Plan IQ 2.6.7 is designed to optimize the layouts of rectangular parts on rectangular panels, minimizing the overall waste and maximizing the efficiency of your cutting process. The software can handle multiple panels in multiple sizes, giving you the best overall set of layouts for your project.
  
Plan IQ 2.6.7 has two versions: one for any type of cut, and one for only edge-to-edge (guillotine) cuts. The any-type-of-cut version is typically used for CNC routers, while the edge-to-edge version is typically used for panel saws.
  
## How does Plan IQ 2.6.7 work?
  
Plan IQ 2.6.7 works by using state-of-the-art algorithms to find the optimal solution for your layout problem. The software takes into account your input parameters, such as the dimensions of your parts and panels, the cutting kerf, the grain direction, the priority of parts, and any other constraints you may have.
  
Plan IQ 2.6.7 then generates a set of possible layouts that meet your requirements and calculates the waste percentage for each layout. The software then selects the best layout or combination of layouts that minimizes the total waste and displays it on your screen.
  
You can also view and edit the layouts in detail, print them out, export them to other formats, or send them directly to your cutting machine.
