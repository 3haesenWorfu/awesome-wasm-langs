## What's New in Autodesk Revit 2018?
 
Autodesk Revit 2018 is not only a software for BIM, but also a platform for design and collaboration. It offers new features and enhancements for architectural design, MEP and structural engineering, and construction. Some of the new features include:

- The Dynamo Player: This tool allows you to run scripts created in the Dynamo graphical programming interface without having to be an expert yourself. You can use the Dynamo Player to automate tasks, optimize performance, and extend Revit functionality[^1^].
- Global Parameters: You can now apply global parameters to radial and diameter dimensions and equality constraints, making it easier to embed design intent in your model. You can also use global parameters to control the visibility of elements based on parameter values[^1^].
- Coordination Model Linking: You can now link a Navisworks file as an underlay in Revit, enabling you to coordinate with outside teams that might not be working in Revit. You can view the linked model in 3D views and use it for clash detection and interference checking[^1^].

## How to Use Autodesk Revit 2018 for BIM?
 
Autodesk Revit 2018 is a powerful tool for BIM that can help you create accurate and coordinated models for design, analysis, documentation, fabrication, and construction. Here are some tips on how to use Revit 2018 for BIM:

- Use worksharing to collaborate with your team members on a central model. You can create local copies of the central model and synchronize your changes with the rest of the team. You can also use worksets to divide the model into logical units and control the visibility and access of elements[^1^].
- Use families to create parametric components that can be reused and modified in your model. You can create custom families using the Family Editor or use the built-in families that come with Revit. You can also load families from external sources or create shared parameters to add custom data to your families[^1^].
- Use schedules to extract data from your model and display it in a tabular format. You can create different types of schedules for elements, materials, keynotes, sheets, views, and more. You can also use formulas, filters, sorting, grouping, formatting, and appearance options to customize your schedules[^1^].

Autodesk Revit 2018 is a comprehensive solution for BIM that can help you design, analyze, document, fabricate, and construct better buildings. By following these tips, you can make the most of Revit 2018 and improve your workflow and productivity.
