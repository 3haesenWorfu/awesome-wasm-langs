Victor Klemperer was a German-Jewish philologist and professor who lived through the Nazi era and documented its impact on the German language and culture. His book *LTI â Lingua Tertii Imperii: Notizbuch eines Philologen* (LTI: The Language of the Third Reich: A Philologist's Notebook) is a fascinating analysis of how the Nazis manipulated and distorted the German language to serve their propaganda and ideology.

In this book, Klemperer exposes the subtle and pervasive ways that the Nazis changed the meaning and usage of words, phrases, and expressions to create a new "language of the Third Reich" that reflected and reinforced their totalitarian worldview. He also shows how this language influenced and corrupted the thinking and behavior of ordinary Germans, as well as how he resisted and subverted it in his own writing.
 
LTI is not only a valuable historical document, but also a powerful warning about the dangers of linguistic manipulation and political indoctrination. It is a must-read for anyone interested in language, politics, history, or human psychology.

Victor Klemperer was born in 1881 in Landsberg an der Warthe, Germany (now GorzÃ³w Wielkopolski, Poland). He studied literature and philosophy at several universities and became a professor of Romance languages and literature at the Dresden University of Technology in 1920. He was married to Eva Schlemmer, a pianist and singer who converted to Judaism to marry him.
 
As a Jew, Klemperer faced increasing discrimination and persecution under the Nazi regime. He was forced to resign from his university position in 1935 and to move into a "Jews' house" in 1940. He was also required to wear the yellow star and to perform forced labor. He survived several deportations and bombings and managed to escape from Dresden during the Allied firebombing in 1945. He was reunited with his wife, who had faked her death and joined the resistance, and they fled to Bavaria.
 
During his ordeal, Klemperer kept a secret diary that recorded his observations and reflections on life under Nazi rule. He also collected examples of Nazi language from newspapers, speeches, posters, slogans, songs, and everyday conversations. He used these materials to write LTI, which he completed in 1947. The book was first published in East Germany in 1957 and later translated into several languages. It is widely regarded as one of the most important and original works of linguistic criticism and cultural history.
