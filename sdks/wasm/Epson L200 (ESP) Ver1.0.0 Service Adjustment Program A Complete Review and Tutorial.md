# How to Reset Waste Ink Pad Counter of Epson L200 Printer with Service Adjustment Program
 
If you own an Epson L200 printer, you may encounter a problem where the printer stops working and displays an error message that says "Service required. Parts inside your printer are near the end of their service life. See your printer documentation." This means that the waste ink pad counter has reached its limit and needs to be reset.

The waste ink pad counter is a feature that keeps track of how much ink is used during cleaning cycles and prevents the printer from overflowing with waste ink. When the counter reaches a certain value, the printer stops working to avoid damage. To fix this problem, you need to use a service adjustment program that can reset the counter and restore the printer's functionality.
 
A service adjustment program is a software tool that allows you to perform various maintenance tasks on your Epson printer, such as resetting the waste ink pad counter, adjusting the print head alignment, checking the ink level, and more. There are different versions of service adjustment programs for different models of Epson printers, so you need to find the one that matches your printer model and version.
 
For the Epson L200 printer, you need to use the Epson L200 (ESP) Ver1.0.0 Service Adjustment Program[^1^] [^2^]. This program is compatible with Windows operating systems only (Millenium, 2000, XP, Vista [in compatibility mode]). You can purchase this program from online sources such as 2manuals.com or orpys.com for a reasonable price. Once you have purchased the program, you will receive a download link and a license key that will allow you to use the program on one computer only.

9. Click Initialization to reset the counters to zero.
10. Click Finish and close the program.
11. Turn off your printer and wait for a few seconds.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset the waste ink pad counter of your Epson L200 printer with the service adjustment program. You can now resume printing without any errors. However, keep in mind that resetting the counter does not solve the problem of waste ink accumulation in your printer. You may need to replace or clean the waste ink pads periodically to prevent ink leakage or damage to your printer. You can also install an external waste ink tank or bottle to collect the excess ink from your printer.
