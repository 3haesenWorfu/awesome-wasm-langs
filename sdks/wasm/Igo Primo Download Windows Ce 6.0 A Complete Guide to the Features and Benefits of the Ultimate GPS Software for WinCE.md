The first step is to download Igo Primo from the official website or a trusted source. You can choose between different versions and languages depending on your preferences and location. For example, you can download Igo Primo Europe or Igo Primo North America.

The third step is to copy Igo Primo to your microSD card. You will need a microSD card that has enough space to store Igo Primo and its maps. You can use any capacity, but we recommend at least 4 GB.
 
Insert the microSD card into your PC using a card reader or an adapter. Format the card to FAT32 if it is not already formatted. Then, copy the entire "Igo" folder from your PC to the root directory of your microSD card. Do not change the name or location of any file or folder.
 
## Step 4: Install Igo Primo on Windows CE 6.0
 
The final step is to install Igo Primo on your Windows CE 6.0 device. Eject the microSD card from your PC and insert it into your device. Turn on your device and go to the file manager or explorer.
 
Locate the "Igo" folder on your microSD card and open it. Find the file named "Igo.exe" and tap on it to run it. You should see a splash screen and then a license agreement. Accept the terms and conditions and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
Igo Primo will start scanning your device for GPS signals and loading maps. This may take a few minutes depending on your device and map size. Once it is done, you should see the main menu of Igo Primo with options such as "Navigation", "Settings", "Extras", etc.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Igo Primo on your Windows CE 6.0 device. You can now enjoy using this powerful navigation software wherever you go.
