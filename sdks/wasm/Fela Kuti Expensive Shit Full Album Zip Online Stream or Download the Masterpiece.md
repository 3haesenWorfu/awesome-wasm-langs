Fela Kuti was a Nigerian musician, activist and pioneer of Afrobeat, a genre that blends jazz, funk, highlife and traditional African rhythms. He was known for his outspoken criticism of the Nigerian government and his charismatic stage presence. One of his most famous albums is Expensive Shit, released in 1975.
 
Expensive Shit consists of two tracks, each lasting about 13 minutes. The title track is based on a true story of how Fela was arrested by the police for possessing marijuana. He managed to swallow the evidence before they could search him, but they took him to a prison cell and waited for him to excrete it. Fela then switched his feces with that of another inmate and escaped conviction. The song is a satire of the police's futile attempt to catch him and a metaphor for the corruption and oppression in Nigeria.

The second track, Water No Get Enemy, is a more mellow and melodic song that praises the importance of water as a source of life and a symbol of unity. Fela sings that water has no enemy because everyone needs it and no one can fight against it. He also urges people to be like water and flow together in harmony.
 
Expensive Shit is widely regarded as one of Fela's best works and a masterpiece of Afrobeat. It showcases his musical talent, political awareness and sense of humor. The album has been reissued several times on vinyl and CD, and is also available as a digital download or stream[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

Fela Kuti was not only a musician, but also a political activist and a Pan-Africanist. He was the son of a Protestant minister and a feminist leader, who both influenced his views on social justice and anti-colonialism. He was also a cousin of Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka. [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]
 
Kuti started his musical career in London, where he studied classical music and jazz. He returned to Nigeria in 1963 and formed his first band, Koola Lobitos. He later changed the name to Africa 70 and then Egypt 80. He also founded his own recording studio and commune, called the Kalakuta Republic, which he declared independent from the Nigerian state.

Kuti's music was influenced by various genres, such as funk, jazz, salsa, calypso and traditional African rhythms. He also used his music as a platform to express his political views and criticize the Nigerian government and its allies. He sang in Pidgin English and Yoruba, making his lyrics accessible to a wide audience. He also coined the term Afrobeat to describe his unique style of music. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
 
Kuti faced many challenges and persecutions for his outspokenness and activism. He was arrested several times, beaten by soldiers, banned from performing, and had his studio burned down by the army. He also lost his mother in the attack on his commune in 1978. He continued to make music and protest until his death in 1997 from complications of AIDS. He was buried with a million people in attendance. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
