## How to Use Woodexpress
 
Using Woodexpress is easy and intuitive. You can start by creating a new project and choosing the type of structure you want to design. You can then draw the geometry of the structure using the mouse or the keyboard, or import it from a DXF file. You can also edit the properties of the elements, such as the cross-section, the material, the supports, and the loads.
 
Once you have defined the structure, you can run the analysis and design module. Woodexpress will automatically check the structure for stability, strength, serviceability, and fire resistance according to EC5. You can also view the results in graphical or numerical form, and see the stress distribution, the deflections, the reactions, and the design ratios.
 
Finally, you can generate the documentation of the project. Woodexpress will produce a comprehensive report that includes all the input data, the analysis results, the design calculations, and the references to the code clauses. You can also export the report to PDF or Word format, or print it directly. Additionally, you can create drawings of the structure and its details, and export them to DXF or DWG format.
